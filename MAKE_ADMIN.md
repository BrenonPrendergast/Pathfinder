# Making Yourself Admin

Since there are no admin users yet, you need to manually create the first admin through Firebase Console:

## Step 1: Sign up to the app first
1. Go to https://pathfinder-000.web.app
2. Create an account (sign up with email or Google)
3. Make sure your user profile is created

## Step 2: Make yourself admin via Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pathfinder-000/firestore)
2. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
3. Click on the `users` collection
4. Find your user document (look for your email)
5. Click **Edit document**
6. If there's no `role` field:
   - Click **Add field**
   - Field name: `role`
   - Field type: `string`
   - Field value: `admin`
7. If there's already a `role` field:
   - Change the value to `admin`
8. Click **Update**

## Step 3: Refresh the app
1. Go back to https://pathfinder-000.web.app
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. You should now see "Admin" in the navigation menu
4. Go to Admin â†’ User Management tab
5. Click "Add Missing Roles" to fix other users

## Alternative: Use Super Admin
- Use `super_admin` instead of `admin` for the role value
- Both roles have the same permissions currently

## After becoming admin:
- You can now manage other users' roles through the admin interface
- The "Add Missing Roles" button will add default `user` roles to anyone missing the role field
- You can promote other users to admin through the dropdown in User Management
